Basic algorithms for learning about how recommendation systems work.
The provided code implements Euclideon Distance method and Pearson correlation coefficient to determine similarity scores.Method Top matches provides you with top matches for each write. The data is taken from predefined dictionary which is at the start of the code.Assuming you have the basic python knowledge you can run the following python code on the python interpreter. More algorithms are to follow.
